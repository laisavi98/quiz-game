# Quiz Game 🎮

Welcome! This is a beginner-level Python project I created while learning how to program.

## 👩‍💻 About the Project
This is a simple quiz game that:
- Asks the user fun questions
- Accepts input (like names and answers)
- Calculates and displays a final score
- Has if/else logic and user feedback

## 🧠 What I Learned
- Python basics (input, print, if/else)
- How to write a multi-step interactive program
- Practicing logic and user input
- How to use Replit and now GitHub!

## 📁 File Included
